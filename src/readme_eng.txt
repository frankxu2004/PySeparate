A Quick Guide:

How to separate a text?

1. Use the "Import text" in the File menu to import a txt file to separate, or manually type the text in the Input textbox. Don't forget to use Clear All button to clear the original text in it!.

2. When finished the text input, click the "Confirm" button to confirm what you want to separate and lock the input text. Then, click the "Separate!" button to start the separation. Be patient because it may take quite a long time!

3. After the text has been successfully separated, the result will show up in the Output textbox. Now you can use the "Save As" in the File menu to save the separation result to a txt file. Don't forget to click "Reset" button before doing another separation or operations.

Advanced Options:
